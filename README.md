# InfoPy Scripts

I wrote these scripts for the 1st semester subject "InfoPy"
(BME EET - Programoz√°s alapjai).

I would say this was the first "proper" attempt for me to start programming
after my previous experimentations, so I figured it would be useful to keep
these scripts as a reference point for myself and others as well.

Since the scripts are short and simple, I won't document them,
nor rewrite them using English variable names and so on,
I think it would be an "overkill" of some sort.

Just to be clear, I don't recommend anyone to copy-paste these
as actual solutions to the subject's tasks, as it would defeat the sole
purpose of the subject, not mentioning that it's also considered plagiarism.

Other than that, feel free to use them any way you'd like to,
